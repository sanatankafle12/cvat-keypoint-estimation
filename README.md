CVAT with Serverless Machine Learning Models

The steps to deploy CVAT using Nuclio and run a model in CVAT are detailed below:
1. Docker Compose to Set Up CVAT

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml up -d

    Purpose: Initializes the CVAT application along with its serverless components.
    Details:
        -f docker-compose.yml: Specifies the primary Docker Compose file for the base CVAT setup.
        -f components/serverless/docker-compose.serverless.yml: Adds additional configurations to enable serverless functionality in CVAT.
        up -d: Starts the defined services in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.
    Outcome: Both CVAT and its serverless infrastructure are deployed and running as Docker containers.

2. Download the Nuclio CLI (nuctl)

wget https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio/releases/download/1.13.0/nuctl-1.13.0-linux-amd64

    Purpose: Downloads the Nuclio command-line interface (CLI), used for managing serverless functions.
    Details:
        wget: Downloads files from the specified URL.
        The URL points to the 1.13.0 release of the Nuclio CLI binary for Linux systems.
    Outcome: The nuctl CLI binary is saved to the current directory.

3. Make the nuctl Executable

sudo chmod +x nuctl-1.13.0-linux-amd64

    Purpose: Adds executable permissions to the downloaded nuctl binary.
    Details:
        sudo: Runs the command with administrator privileges to modify file permissions.
        chmod +x: Adds the executable permission to the file.
    Outcome: The nuctl binary can now be executed from the command line.

4. Add nuctl to the System Path

sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/nuctl-1.13.0-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/nuctl

    Purpose: Creates a symbolic link to the nuctl binary, making it accessible from anywhere on the system.
    Details:
        ln -sf: Creates or updates a symbolic link (-s for symbolic and -f to force replacement).
        $(pwd): Expands to the current working directory where the nuctl binary is located.
        /usr/local/bin/nuctl: Adds the link to the systemâ€™s executable search path.
    Outcome: The nuctl CLI can now be run from any location in the terminal.

5. Create a Nuclio Project

nuctl create project cvat

    Purpose: Initializes a new Nuclio project named cvat.
    Details:
        Projects in Nuclio serve as logical containers for related serverless functions, making it easier to organize and manage them.
    Outcome: A project named cvat is created in Nuclio.
